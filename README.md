This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

# Notes from the author (Max Randle)

This project contains an openapi 3.0 spec that was generated by Claude LLM. This was done by copy-pasting OpenWeather's "one call" endpoint docs from https://openweathermap.org/api/one-call-3, and asking claude to construct an openapi spec from it.

The spec is used to auto-generate TypeScript types for the requests and responses, as well as generate actual react-query hooks for use in the app.

## Tech choice

- Next.js: I specifically chose next.js in this instance because the OpenWeather api responses do not contain CORS headers, and I wanted to avoid setting up a proxy server to handle the requests. Next.js allows for server-side rewrites, which I used to get around this issue.
- React-query: I chose Tanstack Query because many tools exist to automatically generate typed hooks for this tool. I highly value end-to-end type safety. I also like the built in stale-while-revalidate caching strategy and the provided boolean flags for loading, error, and success states.
- Shadcn-ui and Tailwindcss: I didn't see a reason to hand-roll a UI for this project, so I used shadcn ui which is a minimal, copy-pasteable UI kit that I have used in the past. The components are styled using tailwindcss which would already be my default pick.

## Todo (if I were to continue this project)

- Fix up claude's generated api spec. It's pretty inaccurate and it marked a lot of things as optional that should not be, resulting in unnecessary null checks in the code.
- Add API response schema validation against the spec. This will reveal any discrepancies between the spec and the actual API response.
- Unit tests with React Testing Library for the non-ui components.
- Handle api errors.
- Make the future day forecast cards expand to show a more detailed view when clicked on.
- Desktop layout.
